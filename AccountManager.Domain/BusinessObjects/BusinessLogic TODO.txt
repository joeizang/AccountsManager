LOGIC TO DO FOR INCOME:
1. Need to automatically calculate tithe when there is an income entry.
2. Need to automatically calculate deductable tax from any income.
3. Need to add whatever income to actual account balance
4. It would be nice to have the tithe module to automatically deduct the tithe and use interswitch to pay to church account.
5. Need to make sure that the moment an income is captured, account balance is updated and potential deductions should be made


6. For evey update or delete, the record should be duplicated and stored separately from the main data of the application
7. For every delete, the records should not be destroyed, but made non visible to the client calling the records relevant.
8. For every entry made in the entire application, there should be a relevant log entry made to keep track of activities
9. For every income entry there should be a tax deductable that could apply where relevant.
10. Should we use both Javascript for clientside tax deduction calculations or use server side for tax calculations?
